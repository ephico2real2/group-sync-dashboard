# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THE FILES ARE COMMITTED, instead of curl'd during the container build
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A build-time download makes every release depend on npm being up, on the exact version
# still being published (npm permits unpublish), and on the build host having a route out.
# Each of those turns a release into an incident at the moment you can least absorb one.
# Vendoring inverts it: the repository holds everything the build needs, so a build works
# from a checkout alone — offline, in a locked-down network, years later. That is the
# standard answer for air-gapped and supply-chain-sensitive builds, and this chart is aimed
# at exactly those clusters. The cost is ~2.5MB in git and this script.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY npm AND NOT THE CDN — the part worth understanding before you run --upgrade
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The obvious way to pin a file is to download it and hash it:
#
#     curl -sL https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/redoc@2.5.0/... | sha256sum
#
# That is TRUST ON FIRST USE. The hash proves only that the bytes have not changed since
# YOU fetched them. If the CDN had served a tampered file, you would pin the tampered hash
# and every future build would verify it happily, forever — a pin that looks like diligence
# without being it.
#
# So this script never asks a CDN. It goes to the publisher:
#
#   1. GET registry.npmjs.org/<pkg>/<version>  ->  .dist.integrity   (sha512, base64)
#   2. download the release tarball, recompute sha512, compare to that digest
#   3. only then extract the file and record its sha256
#
# What lands in git is the publisher's bytes. Residual trust, stated plainly rather than
# glossed: the npm registry itself and TLS to it. Smaller and more accountable than a CDN
# edge, but not zero — mirror the tarballs to your own artifact store if you need better.
